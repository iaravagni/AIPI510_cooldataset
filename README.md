# Cool Dataset Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores global CO2 emissions data by country, along with an additional dataset on GDP. The project also includes a Unity application to visualize the emissions data in 3D using virtual reality.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iaravagn/AIPI510_cooldataset.git
   cd AIPI510_cooldataset
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of the global CO2 emissions data, including:

- Overview of the datasets
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations of CO2 emissions trends
- Analysis of CO2 emissions compared to GDP


## Visualization

The Unity project provides a 3D visualization of the emissions data, allowing users to interact with the data in a virtual reality environment.
